************************************ Comparing viruses, worms and Trojans
-Propagation Mechanism
    -The way that a malware object spreads

-Payload
    -The malicious action that the malware performs

-Malware
    -Viruses(It spreads through human action)
    -Worm(Spread by themselves) 
    -Trojan Horse(Disguise themselves as beneficial programs)
    -Remote Access Trojans(RAT)
    

************************************ Comparing adware,spyware and ransomeware (Payload)
*Adware - Ads, Pop-ups
*Spyware - Gathers information without user's consent(Logging Keystrokes,Monitoring web browsing, Searching hard drives and cloud storage)
*Ransomware - Block access(Ex. Crytolocker)

*Prevent Malware
    -Anti-malware software
    -Security Patches
    -Educate users

************************************ Understanding backdoors and logic bombs
*Backdoors(Provide workaround access)
    -Hardcoded accounts 
    -Default passwords
    -Unknown access channels

*Logic Bombs(Deliver a triggered payload)
    -Date/time reached
    -File Contents
    -API call result

************************************ Looking At Advance Malware
*Root Account(A special account that provides unrestricted access to system resources)
*Rootkits
    -Escalate user priviledges

*Rootkits Payload ----------------------------------------------------
    -Backdoors
    -Botnet agents
    -Adware/Spyware
    -Antitheft system

*Ring Protection Model

*User Mode vs Kernel Mode
    -User mode Rootkits
        -Run with normal user priviledges
        -Are easy to write and difficult to detect
    -Kernel mode Rootkits
        -Run with system priviledges
        -Are difficuly to write and easy to detect

*Polyporphic Viruses -------------------------------------------------------
    -Change to avoid detection
    
-Signature Detection
    - Identifying viruses by detecting known code patterns from a database.

*Polyporphic Virus Techniques
    -Changing their own code to avoid Signature detection
    -Using encryption with a different key on each infected system

-Armored Viruses(Prevent reverse engineering) --------------------------------------
    -Writing the virus in obfuscated assembly language
    -Blocking the use of system debuggers
    -Preventing the use of Sandboxing


************************************ Understanding BotNets
*Renting out computer power
*Delivering spam
*Engaging in DDos attacks
*Mining Bitcoin
*Waging brute force attack

1.Infect system
2.Convert to bots
3. Infect others
4.Check in
5.Get instructions
6.Deliver payload


************************************ Advanced persistent threats (APT)
-Undiscovered Security vulnerabilities lurk in existing code


*Ethical Disclosure
-Notify
-Provide time to patch it
-Disclose the vulnerability


*Zero Day vulnerability
-vulnerability in a product that has been discovered by at least one researcher but has not yet been patched by the vendor


*Window of vulnerability

Advanced persistent threats (APT) - who are well funded and highly skilled
